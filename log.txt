1.Add a new app.py file and use interactive simulations to understand the properties of linear regression and demonstrate the effects of noise and sample size on the model.

2.Switch to the Streamlit framework

3.use app.py, Synthetic data y = a x + b + ε (ε ~ ​​N(0, σ²)) is generated. Analyze the distribution of x and y to see if they are skewed or contain outliers.

4.use app.py Generation Steps,Fixed random seed for reproducibility,Create a DataFrame and calculate residuals

5.use app.py Trained using Ordinary Least Squares (sklearn.LinearRegression),Ridge / Lasso comparisons available if needed

6.use app.py Metrics: MSE, R²,Visualizations: Scatter plots, residual plots, top-k outliers, Discussion of model performance under different noise/n values
